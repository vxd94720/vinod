Question 7:
Depth=1 → likely underfits (high bias, low accuracy).
Depth=2 → better fit.
Depth=3 → higher training accuracy, test may drop slightly → overfitting signs.

Question 8:
k=1 → very jagged boundaries (overfits, low bias, high variance).
k=3,5 → smoother boundaries (better generalization).
k=10 → overly smooth, may underfit.

Question 9:
Confusion matrix shows per-class performance.
Classification report → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1.
ROC curve + AUC → evaluate separability per class.
